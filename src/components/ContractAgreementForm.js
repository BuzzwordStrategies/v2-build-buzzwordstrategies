          <p>This Marketing Services Agreement (the "Agreement") is made and entered into as of {currentDate}, by and between Buzzword Strategies LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company with its principal place of business at 1603 Capitol Ave Ste 415 #465784, Cheyenne, WY 82001 ("Agency"), and {clientName}, ("Client").</p>
          
          <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Agency is in the business of providing marketing services;</p>
          
          <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Client has selected a specific marketing bundle and tiers through Agency's online platform and has agreed to the terms of such bundle by pressing "accept" on a pop-up confirmation prior to executing this Agreement;</p>
          
          <p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Client desires to engage Agency to provide such services, and Agency desires to provide such services, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein;</p>
          
          <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE</strong>, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the parties agree as follows:</p>
          
          <h4 className="text-[#D28C00] mt-2">1. SERVICES</h4>
          
          <p><strong>1.1 Scope of Services.</strong> Agency agrees to provide Client with the marketing services (the "Services") as specified in the bundle and tiers selected by Client through the Agency's online platform and accepted by Client by pressing "accept" on a pop-up confirmation prior to the execution of this Agreement. The details of the selected bundle and tiers, including the specific services, deliverables, and performance metrics, are incorporated herein by reference and will be provided to Client via email following execution of this Agreement.</p>
          
          <p><strong>1.2 Change Orders.</strong> Any modifications to the Services will require a written change order signed by both parties ("Change Order"). Agency reserves the right to adjust fees and timelines based on approved Change Orders.</p>

          <p><strong>1.3 No Guaranteed Results.</strong> Agency will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner. However, Client acknowledges and agrees that marketing outcomes depend on numerous factors beyond Agency's control, including market conditions, competition, industry trends, Client's products/services, and platform algorithm changes. Agency expressly disclaims any guarantees regarding specific performance metrics, rankings, lead generation volume, conversion rates, or sales results. The testimonials and case studies presented on Agency's website and platform represent specific client results and are not guarantees or promises that Client will achieve similar results. Results may vary substantially based on numerous factors unique to Client's business.</p>
          
          <h4 className="text-[#D28C00] mt-2">2. TERM AND TERMINATION</h4>
          
          <p><strong>2.1 Term.</strong> This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for the initial subscription period of {subLength} months selected by Client as part of the bundle ("Initial Term"), unless terminated earlier as provided herein. Following the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-month periods (each a "Renewal Term") unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term.</p>

          <p><strong>2.2 Automatic Renewal Notice.</strong> CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS AGREEMENT INVOLVES A SUBSCRIPTION THAT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW. Agency will send Client a reminder notice between 15 and 45 days before each automatic renewal date. Client may cancel at any time by contacting support@buzzwordstrategies.com or by logging into their account dashboard.</p>
          
          <p><strong>2.3 Termination by Client During Initial Term.</strong> Client may terminate this Agreement during the Initial Term upon thirty (30) days' written notice to Agency, subject to an early termination fee equal to 50% of the remaining subscription fees due for the remainder of the Initial Term. No early termination fee applies after the Initial Term.</p>
          
          <p><strong>2.4 Termination for Cause.</strong> Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the other party breaches any material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within fifteen (15) days of receiving written notice of the breach.</p>
          
          <p><strong>2.5 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, Client shall pay Agency for all Services performed up to the date of termination, plus any applicable early termination fee. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall survive termination. Agency will provide Client with all deliverables completed as of the termination date within fifteen (15) business days.</p>
          
          <h4 className="text-[#D28C00] mt-2">3. FEES AND PAYMENT</h4>
          
          <p><strong>3.1 Fees.</strong> Client shall pay Agency the fees as specified in the selected bundle and tiers, which include a monthly fee of ${finalMonthly} payable in advance for each month of the {subLength}-month subscription period. All fees are exclusive of taxes, which shall be Client's responsibility.</p>
          
          <p><strong>3.2 Payment Terms.</strong> Client authorizes Agency to charge the payment method provided by Client for all fees when due. Payment shall be made in advance of services rendered, as specified in the selected bundle. Subscription fees will be automatically charged on the same day of each month as the initial subscription date or the nearest available day. Client will receive a receipt for each payment via email. Late payments shall bear interest at a rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less.</p>

          <p><strong>3.3 Refund Policy.</strong> Due to the nature of digital marketing services, no refunds will be issued except in cases of material failure by Agency to deliver the contracted Services. Client shall notify Agency of any material service delivery issues within five (5) business days of such occurrence. Agency shall have fifteen (15) days to remedy any legitimate service issues before a prorated refund will be considered.</p>
